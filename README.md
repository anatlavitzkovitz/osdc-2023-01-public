        * Self employed
        * Training
        * Introducing testing, CI etc.
    * If you'd like to send me an email replay to the one I sent you. Keep the subject line. Remove the irrelevant content.
      Without this it is **very** difficult for me to associate all the emails with the different courses I teach.
    * Assignments
        * Will be in some public GitHub or GitLab repositories
        * At the end of each assignment you'll write a report - a blog post / journal entry.
        * You will add it to your personal JSON file and send a Pull-Request with the change. (We'll learn these soon)
    * The more you participate, the more you learn in this course.
    * The more effort you put in this course, the more you will gain.
        * Ask questions!
        * Try to help others! The more you help others the more you will learn.
    * Grades: (if relevant) are based on the work done during the course. There is no end-project or exam at the end.

* Version Control
    * Why use version control?
    * Wikipedia and the verion control there. Recommended to watch:
        * [How to edit wikipedia](https://code-maven.com/edit-wikipedia)
        * [How to edit wikipedia (in Hebrew)](https://he.code-maven.com/edit-wikipedia)
        * [Como editar una p√°gina en Wikipedia](https://es.code-maven.com/editar-wikipedia)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/): process of contributing to an Open Source project using the GitHub web site. Editing and sending a Pull-Request. Use a the `cm-demo` user to make a change in the README of this repository and then to add the json file. Show how the CI fails when we add an incorrectly formatted file.
* What is [JSON](https://www.json.org/)?

* Show blogging platform
    * [DEV](https://dev.to/) - See [my account](https://dev.to/szabgab/)
    * [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) - See [my side](https://hash.code-maven.com/)

* Show the Git repository of the project and the web site generated from it.

### Assignment

* You will have to publish a journal of your process. You can use any blogging platform, but let me suggest a few:
    * [DEV](https://dev.to/) - shared blogging platform. See [my account](https://dev.to/szabgab/)
    * [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) - shared blogging platform with individual address. See [my side](https://hash.code-maven.com/)
    * [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) - individual platform.
    * [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) - more like a web-site builder than a blogging platform.
* Create an account on the blogging platform you selected. (if you already have one, you can use that)
* Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (if you already have one, use that)
* Create an account on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) (if you already have one, use that)
* Add a picture to all these accounts. It is preferably a picture of you, but it can be a drawing of you, or some other avatar you might want to use.
* Send a pull-request to the GitHub repository of the course adding a JSON file. The name of the file should be your GitHub username and it should include key-value pairs as in the example. (The `posts` will be an empty list.) Check the result of GitHub Actions.
* Join the Slack workspace (I send invitations to everyone to their email address.) and say hi.
* Write a blog post about the course. In your post link to your GitHub and GitLab accounts and to your Pull-Request. If you encountered any issue, write about that and how you solved it. If you use an avatar instead of your own picture, describe how you created the avatar.
* Update your Pull-request adding the URL to the blog post to the `posts` field in the json file.




## Session 2

    * Show the repo of [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask):
        * commits, committers, sha
        * diffs
        * show blame of the README file
        * Comment on a commit
        * Open issue (?)

* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/): just show that it exists

    * just view source in a browser
